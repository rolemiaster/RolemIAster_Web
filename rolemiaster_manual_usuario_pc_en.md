## 🖥️ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND AI MODELS

RoleMIAster works thanks to **Artificial Intelligence** (AI). The game includes local AI models that work **offline** and **without additional configuration**. This section explains everything you need to know about hardware and models.

### ⚙️ Basic Concepts

**Your GPU's VRAM is the most important factor.** RoleMIAster needs a minimum of **12,000-16,000 context tokens** to function correctly.

---

### 📊 AVAILABLE MODELS CATALOG

You can manage and download models from **Settings → Integrated Local AI → Manage Models**.

#### 🏆 Qwen 2.5 Family (Recommended)

| Model | Size | Minimum VRAM | Tier | Gameplay Experience |
|--------|--------|-------------|------|----------------------|
| **Qwen2.5-3B** | ~2.5GB | **8GB** | B | 🆗 Acceptable. Competent but predictable narrative. |
| **Qwen2.5-7B** | ~5.5GB | **12GB** | A | ✅ **RECOMMENDED** - Default model. Excellent narrative. |
| **Qwen2.5-14B** | ~10GB | **16GB** | S | 🌟 Premium. Rich narrative, natural dialogues. |
| **Qwen2.5-32B** | ~22GB | **32GB** | S+ | 👑 Maximum quality. Requires RTX 4090 or superior. |

---

### 🎮 WHICH MODEL TO CHOOSE?

| Your GPU | VRAM | Recommended Model | Quality |
|--------|------|--------------------|---------|
| GTX 1050/1060 | 4GB | Qwen2.5-3B | 🆗 Acceptable (Low context) |
| GTX 1070/1660 | 6GB | Qwen2.5-3B | 🆗 Acceptable |
| RTX 2060/3060 | 8GB | Qwen2.5-3B | 🆗 Acceptable |
| RTX 3070/4060Ti | 12GB | **Qwen2.5-7B** | ✅ Optimal |
| RTX 3090/4080 | 16-24GB | Qwen2.5-14B | 🌟 Premium |
| RTX 4090 | 24GB | Qwen2.5-32B | 👑 Maximum |

**Tip**: Choose a model whose minimum VRAM is **at least 2GB less** than your available VRAM.

---

### ⚠️ IF YOUR VRAM IS INSUFFICIENT

If you select a model that is too large:

1. **The model spills into RAM** → Processed by CPU (much slower)
2. **Degraded response times**:
   - Slight overflow (1-2GB): 30-60 seconds
   - Moderate overflow (3-5GB): 2-5 minutes
   - Severe overflow (>5GB): 10-30+ minutes
3. **Game unplayable** if most of the model is in RAM

#### 🛡️ Solution Protocol for Limited VRAM

If you need to modify AI parameters (or experience instability), follow these steps:

1.  **Conservative Adjustment**: Lower the **VRAM % to 85%**, restart, and test.
2.  **Environment Cleanup**: Check that your GPU VRAM is not hijacked by other processes (browsers, video editors, etc.). Restart PC if necessary.
3.  **Critical Limit**: If lowering to **70%** does not work, **do not improve further**.
    *   *Reason*: The game needs memory to manage prompts. If you assign less than 70%, even if you avoid overflow, the model won't have space to "think" and will fail.
4.  **Last Resort**: If the above fails, **downgrade to a lower model** (e.g., from 7B to 3B), reset AI parameters to "Automatic", and restart.

### ⚙️ LOCAL MODEL CONFIGURATION

In **Settings → Integrated Local AI**:

| Option | Function | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **GPU Layers** | Layers loaded on GPU | -1 (all) |
| **Max Context** | How much the AI remembers | 16384-32768 |
| **Temperature** | Response creativity | 0.7-0.8 |
| **History RAG** | Remembers old events | Yes (long games) |
| **Cache Embeddings** | Accelerates RAG loads | Yes |

---

### 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **AI very slow** | Check GPU Layers = -1, reduce Max Context, close other apps |
| **Memory error** | Reduce Max Context, choose smaller model |
| **Nonsense responses** | Reduce temperature to 0.6-0.7, restart app |

---

### 🌐 ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS (Advanced)

## How to Start?

When you open the game, you will find two main options:

*   **Start a new adventure**: The ideal option to start from scratch! You will be guided through a process to create your character, choose a world, and define the initial premise of your story.
*   **Load an existing adventure**: If you already have a saved game, you can continue where you left off.

## The Game Interface

The main screen is divided into three parts:

*   **Left Panel (Character Sheet)**: Here you can see your character's attributes, skills, and status at all times.
*   **Center Panel (Story and Decisions)**:
    *   **Story Window**: The top part shows the adventure narration.
    *   **Controls**: In the bottom part, the decisions you can take or a text field to write your own actions will appear.
*   **Right Panel (Equipment and Inventory)**: Manage the equipment your character wears and the items found on their journey.

## The Game System: Rules and Mechanics

RoleMIAster uses a rule system to structure your adventures. Knowing it will help you make better decisions!

### 1. Main Attributes

Your character is defined by 7 attributes representing their innate capabilities. During character creation, these are generated randomly, just like in pencil-and-paper RPGs!

*   **Strength (STR):** Physical power and musculature.
*   **Constitution (CON):** Health and resistance to disease and poison.
*   **Size (SIZ):** Height and weight. A large character may be stronger, but less agile.
*   **Dexterity (DEX):** Agility, speed, coordination, and reaction time.
*   **Intelligence (INT):** Learning capacity, memory, and reasoning.
*   **Power (POW):** Willpower, luck, and affinity with magic or psychic powers.
*   **Charisma (CHA):** Leadership, attractiveness, and persuasion ability.

### 2. Derived Characteristics

From your attributes, other vital characteristics are calculated:

*   **Hit Points (HP):** Your total health. Calculated as `(Constitution + Size) / 2`. If they reach zero, you are in serious trouble.
*   **Magic Points (MP):** The energy used to cast spells. Equal to your `Power` attribute.
*   **Action Points (AP):** Determines your speed and who acts first in combat. Calculated as `(Intelligence + Dexterity) / 2`.

### 3. Skills

Skills represent what your character has learned to do. Measured in percentage (%). The higher, the better.

*   **Base Value**: Each skill has an initial value depending on two of your attributes. For example, `Stealth` is calculated with `Dexterity + Intelligence`. This means an agile and intelligent character will have a natural aptitude for being stealthy.
*   **Improvement**: As you use your skills and complete challenges, you will gain experience and be able to improve them.

### 4. Action Resolution (Dice Rolls)

When you attempt something with an uncertain outcome (like climbing a wall, lying to a guard, or attacking an enemy), the Game Master (AI) will ask for a **dice roll**.

*   **How it works?**: The game simulates a roll of a 100-sided die (d100).
*   **The Goal**: To succeed, the roll result must be **less than or equal** to your value in the corresponding skill.
    *   *Example*: If your `Climb` skill is 45%, you need to roll 45 or less to climb the wall.
*   **Success Levels**:
    *   **Normal Success**: You pass the roll. You achieve your goal.
    *   **Critical Success**: If you roll a very low number (usually less than 1/5 of your skill), you do exceptionally well!
    *   **Failure**: You do not pass the roll. You don't achieve your goal.
    *   **Fumble (Critical Failure)**: If you roll 99 or 100, you not only fail, but something goes terribly wrong.

Don't worry about calculations! The game will show you the roll result and the AI will narrate the consequences.

---

## Tips for a Better Experience

*   **Be Descriptive**: When writing a custom action, give details. Instead of "I attack the orc", try "I attempt to dodge his axe and look for a weak point in his armor to stab my dagger".
*   **Experiment**: Don't be afraid to try unexpected actions. The AI is ready to react to your creativity!
*   **Immerse Yourself**: Read descriptions carefully and act as your character would.

## Combat System

When facing enemies, the game enters **tactical combat mode**:

### Turn Order (Tick System)
- Combat works by **ticks** (time segments)
- Your action speed depends on your **Action Points (AP)**
- Slower weapons consume more ticks but usually deal more damage

### Combat Options
- **Attack**: Use your drawn weapon
- **Block**: Adopt a defensive stance (consumes stamina)
- **Flee**: Attempt to escape combat
- **Surrender**: Surrender to your enemies
- **Cast Spell** (Fantasy) or **Use Implant** (Cyberpunk)

### Important Rules
- Only **drawn** weapons count for damage
- **To draw**: Click on the **weapon slot** in the equipment panel
- Moving items during combat has penalties
- Items on the **belt** can be used faster

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Combat Preparation**: 
> Drawing your weapon during combat consumes time (**Ticks**) and leaves you vulnerable. Whenever possible, **draw BEFORE** starting a fight!

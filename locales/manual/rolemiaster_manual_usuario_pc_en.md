# 🐉 Welcome to RoleMIAster!

Grab your dice (or your mouse) and get ready to live adventures where the only limit is how twisted your imagination can be! **RoleMIAster** is an infinite AI-powered role-playing game that lets you be the hero (or the villain) of your own stories.

## ⚠️ LEGAL NOTICE (The boring but necessary part)

**READ THIS OR SUFFER THE WRATH OF THE DICE:**

1.  **🤖 Integrated Local AI:** RoleMIAster brings its own digital brain. It works **without internet** and without you having to touch anything weird. Install and play!
2.  **☁️ Optional Cloud:** If you prefer to spend money on external AIs (OpenAI, Gemini...), that's your business with your credit card. Costs are on you.
3.  **🎲 Generative Chaos:** The AI invents the story on the fly. If the narrator goes crazy and says it's raining cows, don't look at us. The developer is not responsible for the madness generated by the model.
4.  **🏗️ Early Access:** This is under construction. If you find a bug, it's not a glitch, it's a surprise "feature"! (Send us feedback, please, it helps us a lot).

## 🖥️ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND DIGITAL BRAINS (AI)

RoleMIAster works with **Local Artificial Intelligence**. This means your PC will do the heavy lifting of thinking. You don't need internet, but you do need a graphics card that isn't from the dinosaur era. (Note: If your room is cold, this game works as free heating).

### ⚙️ Concepts for Beginners

**VRAM (Video Memory)** is the AI's fuel.
*   RoleMIAster needs to "remember" from **12,000 to 16,000 words (tokens)** to keep up with the story.
*   If your GPU runs out of memory, the game will be slower than a snail with asthma.

### 📊 MODEL CATALOG (Choose your poison)

Manage your AIs in **Settings → Integrated Local AI → Manage Models**.

#### 🏆 Qwen 2.5 Family (The crème de la crème)

| Model | Size | Min VRAM | Tier | Verdict |
|--------|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Qwen2.5-3B** | ~2.5GB | **8GB** | B | 👶 **The Intern.** It gets the job done, but don't ask it to write Shakespeare. Sometimes it gets confused. |
| **Qwen2.5-7B** | ~5.5GB | **12GB** | A | ✅ **THE CHOSEN ONE.** Balanced, smart, and fast. It's the default recommended model. |
| **Qwen2.5-14B** | ~10GB | **16GB** | S | 🧐 **The Professor.** Rich, deep narrative and very natural dialogues. |
| **Qwen2.5-32B** | ~22GB | **32GB** | S+ | 👑 **God Tier.** You need a spaceship (RTX 3090/4090) to run this. |

### 🚨 HELP! MY PC IS SLOW! (VRAM Issues)

If the game takes longer to respond than your crush on WhatsApp, you've probably run out of VRAM.

**Symptoms that you've pushed your luck:**
1.  **The model spills over to RAM:** The PC uses normal memory instead of graphics memory. Result: EXTREME SLOWNESS.
2.  **Mild overflow (1-2GB):** It will take 30-60 seconds per response.
3.  **Moderate overflow (3-5GB):** 2-5 minutes. You can go get coffee.
4.  **Severe overflow:** 10-30 minutes. Unplayable.

#### 🛡️ Emergency Protocol
If things go wrong, follow these steps in order:

1.  **📉 Lower the VRAM %:** Go to Settings and lower it to **85%**. Restart and try.
2.  **🧹 Clean Up:** Close that browser with 40 tabs open. They are eating your memory.
3.  **🛑 The 70% Limit:** Never go below **70%** of assigned VRAM.
    *   *Why?* Because the AI needs space to "think" (the KV cache). If you give it less than 70%, it will go blank and give an error.
4.  **🔙 Tactical Retreat:** If nothing works, downgrade to a smaller model (from 7B to 3B).

### ⚙️ ADVANCED MODEL CONFIGURATION

For those who like to tinker with buttons in **Settings → Integrated Local AI**:

| Option | Function | Recommendation |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **GPU Layers** | How much of the model is loaded onto the graphics card | **-1** (Means "ALL". Don't touch unless you know what you're doing) |
| **Max Context** | The AI's "short-term memory" | **16384 - 32768** (Less than this and the AI will have amnesia) |
| **Temperature** | Creativity vs. Insanity | **0.7 - 0.8** (Higher = crazier; Lower = more robotic) |
| **History RAG** | Remembering things from long ago | **Yes** (Essential for long campaigns) |
| **Cache Embeddings** | Speeds up memory recall | **Yes** (Makes it go faster) |

---

### 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

| Glitch | Fix |
|-------|---------|
| **Slow AI / Lag** | Verify `GPU Layers` is -1. Close Chrome. Lower `Max Context`. |
| **Memory Error (OOM)** | Reduce `Max Context` or choose a smaller model (3B). |
| **AI is Delusional / Hallucinating** | Lower `Temperature` to 0.6. If it's still crazy, restart the application. |

### 🌐 ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS (Experts Only)

> **Note:** The game's built-in local AI is more than sufficient. This is only for advanced or brave users.

*   **External Local Engines:**
    *   **Ollama / LM Studio:** If you already have your own favorite models, you can use them.
*   **Cloud APIs (Paid):**
    *   **OpenAI (GPT), Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek:** Requires internet and spending money.
    *   Configure it in: **Settings → AI → Add New Provider**.

## 🎲 HOW TO PLAY?

When you open the game, you have two paths:

1.  **🆕 New Adventure**: Create your legend from scratch. The game will guide you to choose race, class, world, and premise. (If life gives you lemons... or a 3 in Strength, become a Bard).
2.  **💾 Load Game**: Continue right where you left off before that humiliating death. (Or to fix that "minor miscalculation" with the dragon).

### The Interface (Your cockpit)

*   **Left Panel (YOU):** Your Character Sheet. Health, mana, abilities, and how good-looking you are (Charisma).
*   **Central Panel (THE STORY):**
    *   **Top:** Where the narrator tells what's happening.
    *   **Bottom:** Your decision buttons and the text box to type what you want to do.
*   **Right Panel (YOUR STUFF):** Inventory and equipment. The digital packrat's paradise.

## 📜 GAME RULES (Yes, there are rules)

RoleMIAster uses a classic and robust d100 (hundred-sided die) system.

### 1. Your Attributes (What defines you)
They are generated randomly, just like in classic tabletop RPGs!

*   💪 **Strength (STR):** For hitting hard and lifting stones.
*   ❤️ **Constitution (CON):** For enduring hits, diseases, and poisons.
*   🐘 **Size (SIZ):** Big and heavy, or small and nimble.
*   🏃 **Dexterity (DEX):** Agility, aiming, and not tripping over your own feet.
*   🧠 **Intelligence (INT):** Learning, remembering, and solving puzzles.
*   🔮 **Power (POW):** Your soul, your luck, willpower, and magic.
*   😎 **Charisma (CHA):** Leadership, attractiveness, and ability to trick people.

### 2. Quick Math (Derived Characteristics)
*   **Health (HP):** `(CON + SIZ) / 2`. If it reaches 0... well, you know. F.
*   **Mana (MP):** Equal to your POW. No mana, no tricks. (A wizard without mana is just a guy in a robe cosplay).
*   **Action Points (AP):** `(INT + DEX) / 2`. Determines your Initiative. The one who strikes first, strikes twice.

### 3. Your Skills
They start with a base value (e.g., Stealth = DEX + INT) and improve with use. It's a percentage (%).

### 4. Action Resolution (The Dice)
When you try to do something risky (climbing, lying, attacking...), the AI will ask for a roll.
The game rolls an invisible **d100**. **(Remember: The dice hate you. It's personal).**

*   **Your Goal:** Roll **LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO** your skill.
    *   *Example:* You have 45% in Climb.
    *   You roll a 30: ✅ **Success**. You climb like a monkey.
    *   You roll an 80: ❌ **Failure**. You take a nasty fall.
    *   You roll a 01-05: ✨ **CRITICAL!** You perform epic parkour with a flip.
    *   You roll a 99-100: 💀 **FUMBLE!** Your pants fall down halfway up and you faceplant.

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR NOT DYING (QUICKLY)

*   **✍️ Be Descriptive:** Don't just write "attack." Write: *"I try to dodge his axe by rolling on the ground and stab my dagger in his ankle."* The AI will reward you.
*   **🧪 Experiment:** You're not limited to buttons. Write crazy stuff! The AI will improvise.
*   **🎭 Roleplay:** Get into character. Read the descriptions and act as your character would, not as you would in pajamas.

---

## ⚔️ COMBAT (To arms!)

When words fail, it's time for a brawl. Combat is **tactical** and works by **Ticks** (time).

### 🕹️ How it works:
*   **Ticks:** Each action costs time. Heavy weapons are slow (consume many ticks). Daggers are fast.
*   **Your Speed:** Depends on your Action Points (AP).

### Basic Actions:
*   **🗡️ Attack:** Hit them with whatever you have drawn.
*   **🛡️ Block:** You go on the defensive. Reduces damage but consumes Stamina.
*   **🏃 Flee:** For cowards (or wise ones who want to live).
*   **🏳️ Surrender:** If you see you're not winning, you can beg for mercy.
*   **✨ Magic / Cyberware:** Fire, laser beams, hacks...

### ⚠️ GOLDEN SURVIVAL RULE
**DRAW YOUR WEAPON BEFORE FIGHTING!**
Drawing your weapon in the middle of combat consumes time (Ticks). If you're caught with your sword in its scabbard, you'll get hit until you can get it out. OR WORSE!, IF YOU HAVE YOUR WEAPONS IN YOUR BACKPACK INSTEAD OF THEIR EQUIPMENT SLOT (Excuse me a second, I need to get my greatsword out of my backpack, I'm sure I had it around here... somewhere...) 🤦‍♂️
👉 **Click on the equipped weapon's tag** (right panel) to draw it. It will light up green.

Attempting to move weapons during combat consumes time (Ticks) and can result in a surprise attack, plus you'll very likely lose your turn, miss due to the nerves of the axe approaching your forehead, or drop it on the ground. (Maybe it wasn't a good idea to create a character with ADHD)

## ✨ MAGIC AND CYBERNETICS

Depending on whether your world is "Medieval Fantasy" or "Cyberpunk":

### 🧙‍♂️ Fantasy: Enchantments
Are you a sorcerer? You can enchant your gear.
1.  **Learn:** You need the spell in your grimoire.
2.  **Cast (Drag & Drop):** Drag the spell from your list onto the item in your inventory.
3.  **Cost:** Maintaining an active enchantment **consumes Mana per turn**.
4.  **Warning:** If you run out of mana mid-combat, your fire sword becomes a rusty piece of iron again.

### 🦾 Cyberpunk: Implants
Want eyes with zoom or gorilla arms?
1.  Find a **Cyberdoc** (NPC for hire).
2.  Pay the credits (nothing is free in the future).
3.  **Humanity Cost:** Each implant takes a piece of your soul (**Humanity**).
    *   If you get too many, you'll turn into a **Cyberpsycho** (a killer toaster on legs) and lose control of your character.

---

## 🛒 SHOPS AND SERVICES

Talk to NPCs to trade.
*   **Haggling:** Your **Commerce** skill (based on Charisma) determines prices. If you're ugly or unfriendly, they'll rip you off.
*   **Selling:** **Right-click** on an item in your inventory to sell it to the shopkeeper.

---

## 🎒 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT (Tetris)

*   **Weight:** You have a carrying limit (Strength + Size). If you carry too much junk, you'll be slow and penalized (Diogenes is not your friend).
*   **Panels:**
    *   **Equipment:** What you're wearing.
    *   **Belt:** Quick access in combat (takes less time to use potions from here).
    *   **Backpack:** The bottom of the sack.
*   **Quick Use:** Drag a potion or food directly onto **your face** (your portrait) to consume it instantly.

---

## 🛠️ FINAL SETTINGS

In the **Settings** menu, you can tweak everything:
*   **🌍 Language:** The AI will translate the entire game and responses on the fly.
*   **👁️ Appearance:** Font size and colors, so you don't go blind.
*   **🧠 AI Settings:** Change model, temperature, etc.

---
